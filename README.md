# Movies-ETL
This project introduced us to the concepts of Extract, Transform and Load process, known as ETL. The data from Wikipedia, Kaggle and aggregated ratings were utilized to create a movie database from a clean dataset for fictional Hackathon. To perform this, the ETL process is used to extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from the files, and next transform the dataset via cleaning the rows and formatting datatypes, performing joins, and lastly loading the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL database.
